# AI algebraic chess

## Overview

The project's aim is to build a chess game that's based on [chess algebraic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)) under the hood. The typical drag'n'drop interface layer will be added as well, but the end goal is to connect the project to openAI, having ChatGPT as your opponent - algebraic notation is an effective way to achieve that.
