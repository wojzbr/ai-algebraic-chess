# AI algebraic chess

## Overview

The project's aim is to build a chess game that's based on [chess algebraic notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)) under the hood. The typical drag'n'drop interface layer will be added as well, but the end goal is to connect the project to openAI, having ChatGPT as your opponent - algebraic notation is an effective way to achieve that.

Currently, the interface to interact with the chessboard is exposed in browser console and it includes the following fields:
-pieces
and methods:
-movePiece(piece, newPosition)
-capturePiece(piece)
-validateMove(piece, newPosition)
